# Image Classification rps

## Image Classification on the rock paper scissors dataset of tensorflow

model 1 accuracy = 96% 77% model with more layers  
model 2 accuracy = 99.8% 84% model with less layers
model 3 accuracy = 99.8% 81.1% model with reducedLR
model 4 accuracy = 100% 82.2% model with earlystop
model 5 accuracy = 98% 93.01% changed padding to (3,3) from (2,2)

reason for this is probably overfitting
