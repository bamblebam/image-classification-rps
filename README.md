# Image Classification rps

## Image Classification on the rock paper scissors dataset of tensorflow
My first try at image classification using tensorflow and keras.  
Learned a lot about by convolution neural networks and model optimization.  

### My model accuracy:-

| Model | Training Accuracy | Validation Accuracy | Additional Comments                                   |
|-------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| 1     | 96                | 77                  | Basic CNN model                                       |
| 2     | 99.8              | 84                  | Increased number of layers                            |
| 3     | 99.8              | 81.2                | Integrated reduced LR                                 |
| 4     | 100               | 82.2                | Integrated Early Stopping                             |
| 5     | 98                | 93.01               | Increased padding and MaxPooling from (2,2) to (3,3)  |
| 7     | 98                | 93.28               | Increased the number of convolution layers and epochs |
